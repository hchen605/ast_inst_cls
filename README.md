## Reprogramming a Pre-trained Model for Music Classification Tasks

## Problems of music classification task
Challenge of collecting large-scale datasets
- Resource consuming
- Experts needed -> timbre, genre, etc.
- Crowd sourcing -> Annotation might not be robust

Multi-label problem
 - Polyphonic audios
 - Instrument identification, music tagging -> not fully labeled
 - Missing labels can mean either present or absent instances  -> problematic!

How to detect and classify with insufficient labels?â€‹
- Complex model?
- Advanced semi/self-supervised learning (SSL) approach to handle missing labels
- What else can we do?
